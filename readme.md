# GLIMPSE: Platform System (GLPS)

🚀 **Glimpse (GLPS)** is a cross-platform **windowing and platform system** with a strong focus on **Wayland backend development**. Designed for **flexibility**, **performance**, and **developer sanity** (we try our best, at least).

---

## 🌍 Why GLPS?

Ever wanted a **lightweight, modern** alternative to GLFW that doesn’t force you to wrestle with legacy code? GLPS is here to provide **low-level control** without sacrificing usability. Whether you're managing windows, handling input devices, or integrating graphics, **GLPS has you covered**.

## 🔮 Upcoming Development Priorities

1️⃣ **Multi-Monitor Support** – Because one screen is never enough.
2️⃣ **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Bringing the magic to more platforms.
3️⃣ **Expanded Input Method Support** – Because not everyone uses a keyboard and mouse.

## 🛠️ Logging & Debugging

GLPS is **fully integrated** with [Pico Logger](https://github.com/YASSINE-AA/Pico-Logger), ensuring **structured, real-time** debugging without the chaos of scattered `printf`s.
